Heh, there is + Gordon Laing again, holding his small instrument in his hand... ;-) (remember that reference?:)
One thing that crept in my mind when watching photos of the new Sony without a lens attached was about the size of the sensor vs. the size of the lens mount. Surely that's not an optimal solution, even with the micro lenses in mind. There's a reason why the FT system, and even the mFT system, had a clearly oversized lens mount when compared to the sensor size. I believe that with such a tight fitted sensor inside that lens mount, making reasonably sized lenses that work well with that sensor + lens mount combo cannot be cheap. Looks like the E mount is even more crammed with that FF sensor than the M mount is with one, which also has a slightly longer sensor to mount distance. One would guess that the FE lenses are optically similar to the Leica M mount lenses, only with AF and IS built around the lens groups. On the other hand, I believe only the native FE lenses are likely to work optimally in that system. Any other lens, apart from the APS-sized E mount lenses is likely to be a compromise, one way or other. Suppose we'll find out soon what the bigger focal length lenses will be like, if/when there will be any/some. So all in all, I wonder why did Sony not come up with an entirely new lens mount for the new full frame mirrorless system, rather than using the E mount, which seems to be ideal (designed) for APS-C size sensors. After all, now they will have to come up with new FE lens line, anyway. I wonder if they actually thought about the concept of a full frame sensor inside the E mount originally, or was that a decision made much later. Suppose we'll never know for sure.
+ Josh Whiton Not quite, IMO. The A-mount, which is originally the Minolta AF mount, was made for 35mm (d)SLR cameras. In other words, if you remove the mirror, you still have the same sensor to mount distance. A bit like Pentax did with the K-01. If you simply tried to move the A-mount closer to the sensor and thus eliminate the mirror box space, the lenses designed for the original A-mount would no longer work. You'd still need new batch of lenses. Another little niggle I have about the FF E mount is the use/need of adapters for the A-mount and other full frame lenses. A high enough quality adapter is likely to cost quite a bit, and the end result may still be a compromise. One example of that could be the NEX-7 case. When you attach a wideangle lens not designed for the NEX system, the edges of the image area may turn out purple. The same lens in another NEX or other system camera with less megapixels may not do that. But we'll see, eventually.
Weather sealing, mic input, constant 2.8 aperture and a one inch sensor in a bridge camera? Not bad. Sounds like the first bridge camera that actually makes sense. I for one wish they had opted for even shorter, a 24-105 or whatever lens, but suppose that would have been a bit too much in that particular (bigger number = better) genre.
Maybe in the camcorder terms it is a killer. But does it have built-in ND filter, manual focus + focus peaking, zebra, headphone jack for monitoring, adjustable mic input level and so on? Or, does the multi-function hotshoe work with the Sony XLR/shotgun mic accessory? If yes, then the asking price wouldn't be quite that bad, and it might indeed be an interesting alternative for all sorts of outdoorsy and b-roll shooting. After all, keep in mind that for $1k+ you can get a Panasonic GH3 body or a G6 with a decent lens, a Sony NEX-6 or 7, an a58 with a nice lens, or a Canikon or Pentax dSLR, etc...
I hope it has adjustable mic input level, too. Without it, the headphone jack would be rather pointless, IMO. I'm looking forward to your playing with one and reporting about it in Cameralabs, then.
Can't believe I'm saying this, but I think I'm slowly warming up to the idea of... a bloody bridge camera! At least I do want to check it out now.
I'll edit and reuse my previous comment; It's reasonably small yet well built, good. It's got E-mount, which means smaller flange distance, nice. It's full frame, yay! It's weather sealed, super yay! Apparently it does NOT have the ghastly NEX user interface, happy happy joy joy! But... Man, it's ugly! Too bad the Sony boffins (or did the marketing moguls insist it?) felt compelled to copy the Olympus OM-D pseudo-SLR styling, and actually made an even lousier job than Olympus did. With those basic specs mentioned above, it would have sold well without the silly fake-dSLR styling, too. Too bad they didn't use the RX-10 styling instead. Anyway, the old me would have been much more interested in the A7r, because it has a full frame sensor with no AA-filter. Ooga ooga! (Unless it was an extra, reverse-AA filter á la Nikon D800, which would be a big D'oh!) Nevertheless, I think the new me is actually more interested in the cheaper A7, not only because of the price, but because of video. That is, as long as Sony are using the traditional Bayer sensor in their cameras. I'd like to have a tool capable of doing both stills and video well, as long as that's even feasible. So far I'm not interested in the NFC or WiFi capabilities, other than knowing that they exist and work. Will I buy one? Well, I'm quite tempted, and I might even go for one some time next year, but first I'd like to wait for the RAW updates to appear in Aperture, Lightroom etc, and possibly the first firmware update, too, along with the fellows like + Gordon Laing having a go with the production models first. So when you do get to play with the actual production models, Gordon, please feel free to geek out and pixel peep, measurebate and play with cellphones to your heart's content with the A7r, but I hope you'll take an extra thorough look at the real world video capabilities of the A7. I think some of us are also curious to know just how strong the AA and the IR filters are in the A7.
One more for a good measure... "Are they the models you've been waiting for to finally make the switch from DSLR to mirrorless?" Yes and no. This is the step in the right direction but, I sort of made the switch from DSLR two years ago, at least mentally. I still do have one dSLR but it's a bit of a special case, there's no mirrorless alternative for the design yet. My other digital system cameras are all either fully mirrorless or hybrid, and I'm ready to move on. That includes saying goodbye to OVF. I like a good OVF, but I'm willing to trade it for a good EVF and all the other native digital goodies. "Or are they a niche product which won't impact the sales of models with smaller sensors?" I think they will have an impact. At least they will put a pressure on the pricing of certain other models. I also think that, if not pure game changers, they will make a dent, and are likely to accelerate the mental process of going smaller, lighter and mirrorless in the dSLR-dominated mainstream. I think the acceptance of the mainstream, and not just the camera using one, is the main reason that the new A7 line has that fake retro SLR look. Which has design cues not only from the OM-D, but from the RX line, too. Little something for everyone, I suppose. Just how good are these particular models in real life shooting, we'll see. But since I had a chance to play a bit with the new Canon 70d, and remembering the praising comments of + Gordon Laing in the Cameralabs website, I couldn't help but thinking that despite all the fancy dual pixels, I would no longer wish to buy a dSLR camera of such bulk and weight with only an APS-sized sensor in it. I might as well go for some specialist camera instead, or go for something smaller and lighter. Shooting video with a traditional dSLR style camera would also mean no EVF, and require some awkward accessories. Suppose the "best of the both worlds" argument is valid, sort ot, but I don't think it works for me any longer. I said above that I'm tempted to go for the A7 some time next year, but I think I'm also interested to see what Sony will do with the A-mount, will there be an a99 successor, (I believe there will be at least one more), or are they going to retire the whole A-mount system from now on. I hope not entirely. Perhaps the next cool new toys will appear until Photokina next year, not just from Sony, but from all the other brands as well. Sorry about yet another lenghty post, but suppose I'm a closet geek when it comes to certain kind of camera gear.
+ Theo Brookes If I was ever going to be lured back to dSLR, I think the only camera that could do it now is the Pentax K5IIs or better still, the new K3. Possibly the Canon 70D, too, at least in theory, or the next 5DMkIV, which will probably have the new tech from the 70D. I think the K5 is one of the best APS-sized dSLR's around, because it has a proper pentaprism OVF and proper weather sealing, for a decent price. Which is a killer feature. It also has less bulk than many others, and the ergonomics, along with the control dials, are pretty nice indeed. Apart from the small size and weight, you really cannot say the same for the NEX-7. The A7/A7r is the first weather sealed mirrorless body with a larger than mFT sensor. So if I was in your shoes, I'd probably keep at least the WR lenses you already have, and possibly the K5 body, too, for now, and either look for a used NEX-7 (there will be plenty of them around soon!:) along with a well built K to NEX lens adapter, or go for the A7 body and a K adapter. Did you see the video preview by the Canadian guys? They used a Canon L lens and a Metabones adapter with the A7r. Oh and BTW, Pentax have already made one mirrorless body, albeit not very successful one, so I wouldn't be surprised if Ricoh/Pentax came up with something new and better, too, eventually.
Well, the main point is that you would be able to use them, albeit in manual mode. In other words, you woluldn't have to dump your existing K glass for new NEX glass, unless you really wanted to. It'll make the change of a brand much easier and less expensive right from the beginning.
My first camera was a Yashica MG-1, and my first slr camera was somewhat similar to yours, + Gordon Laing , a Minolta SRT-100x. Loved both. My parents wouldn't let me convert a bathroom into a darkroom, for practical reasons I suppose, but I would process all my b/w films myself, and then go to make prints elsewhere.
So it's basically a simple rig for the iPad mini. Okay, cool. I agree with John, that frame is actually a clever iPad accessory. Kudos to Dave Basulto for a refreshingly quirky idea and out of the box thinking. I'd love to have a full size iPad version for my regular iPad. I wouldn't give a damn about looking dorky using it. Add a sun shade of some sort to that rig and FilmicPro in the iPad, and you're good to go. Which brings up a few questions for you + John Pozadzides ; a) what is that lens attached to the black version, and b) is there a 37mm plastic thread in the rig for that lens? Or how do you attach the lens securely, and so that it'll be 100% perfectly aligned for the iPad lens? c) What about the Røde videomic, how did you attach it to the iPad and adjust the volume?
Apart from the pricing, I've got an entirely opposite POV. I for one would strongly recommend against a bridge camera for any new photographer. I'd never recommend them for anyone, because traditionally they combine the worst of both compact and system cameras, and leave out the best of each. The usual bridge cameras are all about big numbers, quantity over quality. Having said that, at the first glance this new RX-10 seemed to be the first bridge camera that makes sense, until you see the price tag.
Now I'm a bit confused. Your first comment sounded sad, as if something terrible had just happened, or at least something less than pleasant took place prematurely, and now you're telling about exiting news... scratching head
Why playing with vintage looks, when you've got real vintage tools to play with? After all, the real thing always beats the fake, whether it's about the attributes of an actual woman, or those of a photo of one. ;-)
My earlier experience with Leica R lenses on a small NEX-size body was that, apart from the weight (very front-heavy, depending on the lens) and the noticeable purple fringing, they were reasonably nice. Not spectacular, but nice. My guess the same will be true for Leica M lenses, which will probably not be spectacular on a camera like this, but nice, anyway. Suppose it depends on the design of the sensor and its IR filter. We'll see. Even though the full frame with no AA filter in the A7r is quite tempting, I think I'm even more interested in the A7 right now, because of video. But again, we'll see. Too bad they decided to go for the OM-D-esque fake retro SLR look, instead of using the more modern a99/RX10 look.
Although the NEX battery is smaller than the SLT battery, Frank. It probably will be hungrier for spare batteries, but we'll see. I think the new A7/r is interesting, but looks hideous.
+ Owen Lloyd One shock at the time, man. Dumping the mirror and OVF for an EVF was/is a shock big enough for the mainstream, so better save the next one for a year/generation or two later. Or maybe it'll happen during the Photokina next year. ;-)

I still do have one dSLR but it's a bit of a special case, there's no mirrorless alternative for the design yet. My other digital system cameras are all either fully mirrorless or hybrid, and I'm ready to move on. That includes saying goodbye to OVF. I like a good OVF, but I'm willing to trade it for a good EVF and all the other native digital goodies. "Or are they a niche product which won't impact the sales of models with smaller sensors?" I think they will have an impact. At least they will put a pressure on the pricing of certain other models. I also think that, if not pure game changers, they will make a dent, and are likely to accelerate the mental process of going smaller, lighter and mirrorless in the dSLR-dominated mainstream. I think the acceptance of the mainstream, and not just the camera using one, is the main reason that the new A7 line has that fake retro SLR look. Which has design cues not only from the OM-D, but from the RX line, too. Little something for everyone, I suppose. Just how good are these particular models in real life shooting, we'll see. But since I had a chance to play a bit with the new Canon 70d, and remembering the praising comments of + Gordon Laing in the Cameralabs website, I couldn't help but thinking that despite all the fancy dual pixels, I would no longer wish to buy a dSLR camera of such bulk and weight with only an APS-sized sensor in it. I might as well go for some specialist camera instead, or go for something smaller and lighter. Shooting video with a traditional dSLR style camera would also mean no EVF, and require some awkward accessories. Suppose the "best of the both worlds" argument is valid, sort ot, but I don't think it works for me any longer. I said above that I'm tempted to go for the A7 some time next year, but I think I'm also interested to see what Sony will do with the A-mount, will there be an a99 successor, (I believe there will be at least one more), or are they going to retire the whole A-mount system from now on. I hope not entirely. Perhaps the next cool new toys will appear until Photokina next year, not just from Sony, but from all the other brands as well. Sorry about yet another lenghty post, but suppose I'm a closet geek when it comes to certain kind of camera gear.
+ Theo Brookes If I was ever going to be lured back to dSLR, I think the only camera that could do it now is the Pentax K5IIs or better still, the new K3. Possibly the Canon 70D, too, at least in theory, or the next 5DMkIV, which will probably have the new tech from the 70D. I think the K5 is one of the best APS-sized dSLR's around, because it has a proper pentaprism OVF and proper weather sealing, for a decent price. Which is a killer feature. It also has less bulk than many others, and the ergonomics, along with the control dials, are pretty nice indeed. Apart from the small size and weight, you really cannot say the same for the NEX-7. The A7/A7r is the first weather sealed mirrorless body with a larger than mFT sensor. So if I was in your shoes, I'd probably keep at least the WR lenses you already have, and possibly the K5 body, too, for now, and either look for a used NEX-7 (there will be plenty of them around soon!:) along with a well built K to NEX lens adapter, or go for the A7 body and a K adapter. Did you see the video preview by the Canadian guys? They used a Canon L lens and a Metabones adapter with the A7r. Oh and BTW, Pentax have already made one mirrorless body, albeit not very successful one, so I wouldn't be surprised if Ricoh/Pentax came up with something new and better, too, eventually.
Well, the main point is that you would be able to use them, albeit in manual mode. In other words, you woluldn't have to dump your existing K glass for new NEX glass, unless you really wanted to. It'll make the change of a brand much easier and less expensive right from the beginning.
My first camera was a Yashica MG-1, and my first slr camera was somewhat similar to yours, + Gordon Laing , a Minolta SRT-100x. Loved both. My parents wouldn't let me convert a bathroom into a darkroom, for practical reasons I suppose, but I would process all my b/w films myself, and then go to make prints elsewhere.
Whether to upgrade or not, well, that's a tough question only you can answer. There's the old saying if it ain't broken, don't fix it. On the other hand, if you're no longer happy with it, why not getting a new one. The digital cameras are getting incremental improvements with each new release, and the new Sony SLT models do have some improvemenrs over the older models, like the image sensor. The good news is, your lenses that attach to your existing body will also attach to any of the Sony Alpha line models, as they all use the same Minolta/Sony lens mount. So no worries there. So what would I recommend, well, it depends on how much money you wish to spend on a new camera. Judging by your existing camera, I believe you'd be happy with the performance you'd get with the Sony a58. It's the latest entry level A-mount model, but according to some tests and my own experience, it does deliver quite impressive results. You can also shoot decent video with it. Plus, it's relatively inexpensive for the performance it delivers. A lot of bang for the buck. The only detail I don't like about it is the fact that the outer ring of the lens mount is plastic, but that's not supposed to be a major issue. Tech-savvy owners can even change it to a metal one, but I don't think the plastic mount would be a major issue for you. It's more of a psychological issue than a technical one. In case you happen to have a fancy flash unit for your current camera, you might also be interested in the older a57 model, which still has the old non-standard hot shoe. But if you don't own a flash for the old camera, you might as well go for the newer a58 instead. Besides, even if you do have a flash for the old hot shoe, you can buy an adapter for it for about 30 bucks. So no biggie. In case you love the outdoors and love to shoot in all sorts of weather, you might want to go for the a77, which is weather sealed. So is the top of the line model a99, which also packs a bigger, 35mm "full frame" sensor. But those fancier models are also bulkier, heavier and much more expensive. $800 up to $1,000 for the a77, and around $2,000 or more for the a99. Given the fact that your current body is not weather sealed and you've been doing just fine with it, you might be content with a57, a58 or a65. Another little thing to remember is that all these new Sony SLT models mentioned have an electronic viewfinder. It may feel a bit weird for the first few days but, once you get used to it you'll probably end up loving it, because the EVF has some neat features that are not possible with the traditional optical viewfinder your current camera has. Nevertheless, because it's also a matter of taste, I recommend that you try finding a store in your area that is carrying the Sony models and see what it feels like. But even if you intend to buy one online, believe me, the EVF is not such a big deal, and you will get used to it. After a few years, most cameras will be like that. As for the ergonomic design of those models, each of them, even the a58 will be an improvement over the A-230. The user interface will be instantly familiar, too. I guess this is a really long way of telling you that any of the current Sony SLT models will do just fine, and you should just pick one that feels fine in your hand and fits within your budget, and that your existing lenses will work just fine.
Well, I think it's yes on both counts. Yes, the A230 can "handle" the lens, and yes, a newer camera is likely to give you better results. If you fancy such a mighty lens, getting something bigger and more rugged like the a77 or even a99 wouldn't be a bad idea. Albeit a clearly more pricy one. Then again, if/when you go for a big lens like that, you will be using a tripod or monopod, too, so any of the Sony Alpha bodies will work with the lens. The better the body, the better the photos will be.
