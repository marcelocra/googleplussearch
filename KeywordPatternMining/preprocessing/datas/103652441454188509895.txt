Worlds Fastest Bird ... in my backyard For the last 5 years I've had this bird swooping and taking little birds on our lawn. So we've been putting a bit more bread out there lately. He sits up in a bird tree on this hill over a Kilometre away. As the birds arrive he dives and is out of view going to the flow of the landscape down this hill. As last moment he spreads his wings to brake and take his snatch. Takes him to the tree and have a snack. One would say you dont see that every day. Around spring time its quick frequent. Sometimes he doesnt scare them all away for the day it can be around 20 swoops. Can be sunbathing and hear this woooooosh. Yesterday sitting in the lawn he chased a little bird into our window, was laying on the deck stunned, Slowly and sneakily snatched the bird for a feed in the tree. Plucking and nawing into it. And this was only metres away! Above info is presuming the falcon is a male ha. Also tickets will $5 per visit. Only pro photographers allowed... ha no mirrorless ae + Gordon Laing haha. Here's a video where you can see the moment I shot this photo. This was on the Point of Veiw Action Camera set up on the lawn: #PeregrineFalcon #Nature #WildlifeInTheBackyard + Sony #SonyActionCam #Sony #ActionCam #Falcon #worldsFastest #prey #Queenstown #nz

Have you got one? Not sure how old these are but they look really cool for what it is. Waterproof, ringflash, 5MP quick snap camera. I take its now Point, Shoot and Share? Quirky and cool, I kinda want. What do you think? more info: theQ camera - Shut Up & Shoot #TheQCamera #filters #pocketcamera #ringflash #photography #pointandshoot #PointShootandShare + Gordon Laing
+ Craig Pifer yeah a little high priced but pretty cool toy. Don't think anything else out there. You can chuck around between your mates and not worry about it. Use it at the beach, wont matter if it gets wet. It aint about quality with 5MP, just capturing the moment. Iphone/smartphone too important to loose. Not everyone has time for film, people loved intagram, this could be great too!
+ Craig Pifer Heaps of online storage out there for free so I wouldnt stress about that. Get this company off the ground before any demands like that. Rather have a quirky camera that be even further improved.
+ Gordon Laing I'm not too fussed on the sharing at all really, would prefer if it didnt have it. Do enough time on the web/comp!! More the fact of having a camera that you don't have to worry about at all. It can get chuck in a bag without a case. Its nothing about quality. Whatever you shoot is a captured moment, you can have this where ever. Where as taking the RX1 or 5D3 round, you want to show off the quality and get sick images. And the worry about it getting damaged or have restrictions where you can take it. I think its awesome for backpackers or travellers that just want the moment caught.
